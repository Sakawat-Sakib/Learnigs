(Sheryians Coding School*)

- primitive data type : simple data type (number, char, boolean)
- non-primitive data type : complex data type (class, object, string)
- try not to use type 'any'
- we can also set the data type for a function based on what it will return
- we can write 'void' if the function doesn't return any thing
- type aliases: making own type
- we can extend interface
- literal : mainly to fixed a value for a variable
