- tuple used to store mixed data
- data type : any (use when not sure about the data type)
- type inferrance : understanding variable type without explicitly declaring the type
- union type : to declare a variable with multi type
- add '?' in function parameter to mark as optional
- optional parameter always need to be after required parameter
- we can pass object as a parameter in function
- interface : to solve the problem of 'so many field in an object' to use as parameter of function
- if 'private' modifier is used in any property in a Class then that property can only be access within that Class
- even child class also can't access that property
- if 'protected' modifier is used : child class can access that property
- in both cases (private and protected) : that property can't be used outside of Class (parent, child)
